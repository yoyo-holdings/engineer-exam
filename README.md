* Specifications

  1. The app consists of two major activities:
     - a note-taking activity that accepts a `title` and `text` for one
       or more notes
     - a TODO tracking activity that accepts an `entry`, with a
       `checkbox` to show whether this entry has been done or not done
  2. The app should have a user interface that allows for easy access
     between the note-taking and TODO tracking activities as well as to
     see their details at a glance.
  3. The note-taking activity should provide a view for its notes in a
     reverse-chronological order, with options for updating and deleting
     old notes.
  4. The TODO-tracking activity should provide a view for its entries
     with options for updating and deleting old TODOs.
  5. The app should make it easy to switch between the note-taking and
     TODO-tracking activities.
  6. The app should make it easy to switch a note to a TODO entry, and
     vice versa.
  7. The app should consists of both frontend and backend.
  8. Use `TypeScript` for the frontend and backend
  9. Include Unit/Functional Tests and make sure both has 70% and up test coverage
  10. Wrap everything on a docker container and make sure we can run both frontend and backend using `docker-compose up`
